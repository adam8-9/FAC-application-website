                    <p>The earliest I can remember of me being fascinated by technology was a tetris game that I played
                        on
                        a hand held console(looked like a rip-off gameboy) when I was around 3 or 4 years old, I don't
                        even know how I remember that
                        probably beacuse of the curiosity
                        it created of how are these blocks appearing out of thin air and dissapear moments later, or how
                        I couldn't touch them and only move them through the buttons.
                        This fascination only grew over time as technology developed throughout the years and allowed us
                        to carry out more complex tasks.</p>
                    <p>
                        Fast track to 2015-16 I took computer science as one of my GCSE's and made a
                        computer output
                        "Hello World" in python, I'm not going to say that's when I fell in love with coding from then
                        on out,
                        it was actually when we were given projects for the final year of GCSE's, I was pretty nervous
                        about this since I thought coding was too difficult but during my summer holidays I tried to
                        learn the basics of python from an app called solo learn. I would learn whenever I was
                        travelling or
                        when I was free at home, I thorougly enjoyed it and when the time came to making the project it
                        just made realise how fun coding can be, even if it was challenging I learned new
                        things
                        and the best part was the ecstatic feeling of solving problems even if it took hours or
                        sometimes days!</p>
                    <p>The last project I was assigned was in A level's where I decided to make a fighting game with
                        unity and C#, this was one of the most challenging tasks ever but will always be one of the most
                        fun
                        I've ever had coding. It wasn't just coding, I also learnt how to use unity, making animations
                        with sprites, and testing it with my friends(yeah we played in
                        the classroom for educational purposes). We also would look at each other's projects and help
                        each
                        other out, this showed me the diverseity of coding entails and not just some logic on your
                        screen. So my
                        overall opinion of coding is that it's cool and and you can use it in cool different ways to
                        help and make an impact in society and I persoanlly feel becoming a web developer will help me
                        be a
                        part of that impact(a positive one, just to be clear). </p>

                <div class="reasonContent hide">
                    <p>After finishing A'levels a few months early due to the covid outbreak in 2020, I had already
                        taken a gap year to think about what I want to do for my future, I didn't want to take out a
                        loan due to personal reasons, unless worst comes to worst. I tried to work and save some money
                        but that lasted for 3 months due to the 3rd covid outbreak.
                    </p>
                    <p> So I tried to search for
                        apprenticeships
                        instead on the internet that's when I found Founder And Coders, It seemed so different to any
                        other apprenticeship I've come across, one of the main differences is creating a platform for
                        people to interact and learn. Another is also the fact that FAC also guides their members on
                        their journey to becoming a web developer through the numerous channels on discord, posting
                        daily challenges and holding weekly meetups.
                    </p>
                    <p> As a muslim with Indian origin I really respect the
                        core values
                        of FAC trying to help the underprivileged and creating a environment that is diverse and
                        inlclusive, since this is also inline with my religion/personal view of treating everyone the
                        same and giving
                        equal opportunties. That's why I would like to be apart of this commnunity, continue to grow and
                        help
                        others that are marginilised and struggling to get into this field. </p>
