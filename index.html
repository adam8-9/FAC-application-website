                    <p>the earliest I can remember of me being fascinated by technology was a tetris game that I played
                        on
                        a hand held console when I was around 3 or 4 years old, dont even know how I remember that
                        probably beacuse of the curiosity
                        it created of how are these blocks appearing out of thin air and dissapear moments later, or how
                        I couldn't touch them and only move them through the buttons.
                        This fascination only grew over time as technology developed throughout the years and allowed us
                        to carry out more complex tasks.</p>
                    <p class="bottom">
                        Fast track to 2015-16 I took computer science as one of my GCSE's and made a
                        computer output
                        "Hello World" in python, I'm not going to say that's when I fell in love with coding from then
                        on out,
                        it was actually much after that when we were assigned to make a game in my last year of A
                        level's, that's when I faced challenges and learned new things
                        and the best part was the ecstatic feeling of solving problems even if it took hours or
                        sometimes days!.</p>
                    <p>Even though I made a game that was playable I didn't know the fundementals of the programming
                        language I was using at the time(C#) untilbasics of </p>
